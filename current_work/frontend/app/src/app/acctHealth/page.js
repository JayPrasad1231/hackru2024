          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Importance of Account Health</h2>
          <p>
            An aspect of sports betting that is often overlooked is account health. Due to the potential for substantial profits, sportsbooks frequently limit successful players. To continue making profitable EV and arbitrage bets, consider the following tips and tricks.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Maximize Player Props</h2>
          <p>
            Player props often draw attention from sportsbooks since many casual bettors overlook them. On smaller sportsbooks like <strong>SuperBook</strong> or <strong>Tipico</strong>, take advantage of mistake lines without wasting time on smaller EV plays, as you won't gain the full advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            While betting player props can have negative implications for your account, it remains acceptable on larger sportsbooks like <strong>FanDuel</strong> and <strong>DraftKings</strong>, where it won’t significantly impact your account health.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Adopting a "Dumb" Bettor Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes, it can be beneficial to appear less knowledgeable to the sportsbook. Placing live bets, which typically have a higher vig, often fits this strategy and can help keep your account healthy. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider placing a few “dumb” live bets occasionally to maintain a balanced account profile. Same game parlays also can make you appear more like a “square” bettor. Since these parlays often have high correlation values, they are generally favorable for the sportsbook.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Betting on Mainlines</h2>
          <p>
            Betting on mainlines is an effective strategy for maintaining account health. These lines are among the most common bets made by casual sports bettors, so finding positive EV opportunities here is recommended.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Strategizing Your Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Both positive EV betting and arbitrage betting can lead to sportsbooks limiting your accounts. Larger sportsbooks like <strong>FanDuel</strong>, <strong>DraftKings</strong>, <strong>Caesars</strong>, and <strong>BetMGM</strong> typically impose limits slowly, while smaller sportsbooks can act quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            We advise starting with larger sportsbooks to build your bankroll. Once you’ve established a solid bankroll, take advantage of smaller sportsbooks before they eventually impose limits.
